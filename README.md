# CS Primer
On 03/15/2025, I signed up for a year-long subscription, and started solving problems on csprimer.com.

## Background
- Took one live course in Computer Architecture with Bradfield School of CS
- Read "But How Do It Know?" and "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"
- During the pandemic, I got really into and finished the programming sims "Human Resource Machine" and "Silicon Zeroes"
- Studied more Data Structures & Algorithms and Distributed Systems than I care to admit for various interview loops

## Motivation
I didn't study CS in undergrad, but I've been working as a Backend Software Engineer for the past seven years. I am really good at getting things done with just the least amount of background knowledge needed. Doing things this way feels fun and empowering, but I'm ready to stitch together a stronger conceptual understanding of how things work under the hood of the abstractions I work with every day.

## Planned Sequencing:
I feel I already have a good foundation on Data Structures & Algorithms and Distributed Systems, so I will skip those in favor of getting to other less well-trodden topics.

- Computer Systems
- Operating Systems
- Computer Networks
- Relational Databases

## Desired Level of Completeness
My goal is to solve 70-80% of problems in each topic on my first pass. Aim is to leave 20-30% of problems unsolved so that I can revisit them in subsequent passes, in the spirit of the circular learning model.

There are also a lot of recommended extra resources and textbooks. My goal is NOT to jump on these side quests at first. I think this will help keep me focused on solving problems instead of passively reading and watching lectures.
